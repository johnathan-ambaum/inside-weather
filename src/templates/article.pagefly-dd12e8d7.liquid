A side table is a small surface area, so it’s actually relatively easy to style. However, you do need the right items and the right ideas to make this small space come to life. <br><br>With these side table styling tips, you’ll learn how to decorate a side table so it speaks to your style and your vibe, whether it’s by your sofa, by your bed, or by your dog’s water bowl. We’ll also share a few great end table ideas that you can copy guilt-free or use to inspire your own unique design.&nbsp;</span></p><p class="sc-TtZnY fPBQTR pf-77_ avalon-demi" data-pf-type="Paragraph"><span data-pf-type="Text" class="sc-eGJWMs gQYBcx pf-76_">The Dos and Don’ts of Side Table Styling</span></p><p class="sc-TtZnY fPBQTR pf-23_" data-pf-type="Paragraph"><span data-pf-type="Text" class="sc-eGJWMs gQYBcx pf-25_">When it comes to styling anything, from an entire space to an accent or side table, you should always let your creativity run wild. However, there are a few rules or guidelines to side table styling that can be quite helpful. We have found that following these dos and don’ts not only inspires creativity but also produces results that are both beautiful and functional.&nbsp;</span></p><p class="sc-TtZnY fPBQTR pf-20_ avalon-demi" data-pf-type="Paragraph"><span data-pf-type="Text" class="sc-eGJWMs gQYBcx pf-22_">Do: Add a Table Lamp&nbsp;</span></p><p class="sc-TtZnY fPBQTR pf-74_" data-pf-type="Paragraph"><span data-pf-type="Text" class="sc-eGJWMs gQYBcx pf-73_">Lighting is often overlooked, but it’s one of the most influential factors in any room. If your space is lacking overhead lighting, or you want to be able to create ambiance with the flick of a switch, you should strongly consider incorporating a lamp into the room, and a side table is a perfect place to put it. If your side table is your nightstand, it’s especially useful to style it with a table lamp so you can shut off the lights almost as quickly as you can clap.&nbsp;</span></p><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2994/0144/t/185/assets/pf-26f1a7ce--071721decoratesidetable01.jpg?v=1626557556" srcSet="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2994/0144/t/185/assets/pf-26f1a7ce--071721decoratesidetable01.jpg?v=1626557556 1536w, https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2994/0144/t/185/assets/pf-26f1a7ce--071721decoratesidetable01_500x.jpg?v=1626557556 320w" width="890" height="540" data-pf-type="Image" class="sc-carFqZ hBWCUB pf-26_"/><p class="sc-TtZnY fPBQTR pf-27_" data-pf-type="Paragraph"><span data-pf-type="Text" class="sc-eGJWMs gQYBcx pf-29_">There are thousands of table lamps to choose from, but the most important thing to consider when selecting a lamp for a side table is size. Scale is what makes the pieces in your <a href="https://insideweather.com/pages/living-room" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); text-decoration-line: underline;">living room</a> or <a href="https://insideweather.com/pages/bedroom" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); text-decoration-line: underline;">bedroom</a> all fit together. So, choose a table lamp with a height and base that is at least a third shorter and half as small as the height and surface area, respectively, of the side table. The bottom of the shade of the table lamp should be at eye level when seated as well. This will ensure your view isn’t blocked by a lampshade that is too low and you aren’t blinded by the light because the lampshade is too high.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="sc-TtZnY fPBQTR pf-30_ avalon-demi" data-pf-type="Paragraph"><span data-pf-type="Text" class="sc-eGJWMs gQYBcx pf-32_">Do: Stack Items</span></p><p class="sc-TtZnY fPBQTR pf-33_" data-pf-type="Paragraph"><span data-pf-type="Text" class="sc-eGJWMs gQYBcx pf-35_">Books, vases, candles, you name it, you can stack it on a side table. Stacking is a great way to fit multiple items on the small surface area of a side table and to add visual dimension. Start with a few large books or magazines and stack smaller books, a vase or pitcher, and decorative bowls or beads on top. In a matter of moments, you’ll transform your end table into an art piece.&nbsp;</span></p><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2994/0144/t/185/assets/pf-f1a7ce60--071721decoratesidetable02.jpg?v=1626557686" srcSet="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2994/0144/t/185/assets/pf-f1a7ce60--071721decoratesidetable02.jpg?v=1626557686 1536w, https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2994/0144/t/185/assets/pf-f1a7ce60--071721decoratesidetable02_500x.jpg?v=1626557686 320w" width="890" height="540" data-pf-type="Image" class="sc-carFqZ hBWCUB pf-36_"/><p class="sc-TtZnY fPBQTR pf-40_ avalon-demi" data-pf-type="Paragraph"><span data-pf-type="Text" class="sc-eGJWMs gQYBcx pf-42_">Don’t: Overload the Space</span></p><p class="sc-TtZnY fPBQTR pf-43_" data-pf-type="Paragraph"><span data-pf-type="Text" class="sc-eGJWMs gQYBcx pf-45_">While we love the stacked look, a side table can become crowded quickly. If you aren’t happy with how your side table is looking, remove items instead of adding them. This will not only help you achieve a clean look, but also allow space for you to set a glass or coffee cup, or a vase when you get surprised by a bouquet of flowers. If you have few other surfaces available in any given room, it’s even more important to not overload the surface of your side table so it’s there for you when you need it.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><p class="sc-TtZnY fPBQTR pf-46_ avalon-demi" data-pf-type="Paragraph"><span data-pf-type="Text" class="sc-eGJWMs gQYBcx pf-48_">Don’t: Forget About Function</span></p><p class="sc-TtZnY fPBQTR pf-49_" data-pf-type="Paragraph"><span data-pf-type="Text" class="sc-eGJWMs gQYBcx pf-51_">The placement of a side table will contribute to its function in the space. If you set it by your sofa, it may be a place to set beverages (hint: add coasters), if it’s next to your bed, it may be a home for your glasses and phone. Consider what the side table will be used for before you begin styling it. This will influence what you fill the space with or if you fill it with much at all.

Maybe your kitchen is short on storage and you want to use a side table to showcase your grandmother’s tea set, or maybe you’re always writing notes on napkins and need the space for notebooks and pens. <br><br> A side table doesn’t have to function as a space for your keys and coffee, it can function as a home for your beautiful knick-knacks too. You just have to be clear about how you want and need it to function from the start so you can decorate it accordingly.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2994/0144/t/185/assets/pf-a7ce603d--071721decoratesidetable03.jpg?v=1626557797" srcSet="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2994/0144/t/185/assets/pf-a7ce603d--071721decoratesidetable03.jpg?v=1626557797 1536w, https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2994/0144/t/185/assets/pf-a7ce603d--071721decoratesidetable03_500x.jpg?v=1626557797 320w" width="890" height="540" data-pf-type="Image" class="sc-carFqZ hBWCUB pf-52_"/><p class="sc-TtZnY fPBQTR pf-53_ avalon-demi" data-pf-type="Paragraph"><span data-pf-type="Text" class="sc-eGJWMs gQYBcx pf-55_">5 Side Table Decor Ideas&nbsp;</span></p><p class="sc-TtZnY fPBQTR pf-56_" data-pf-type="Paragraph"><span data-pf-type="Text" class="sc-eGJWMs gQYBcx pf-58_">Now that you know the rules, it’s time to craft your ideal surface.

Create the ideal setting to read a book by using your side table to hold a reading lamp, a coaster for your mug, and, of course, a few books. For easy organization, opt for a side table that has a shelf to store whatever you’re reading at the moment.

You can use a side table by your entryway to act as the perfect place to put your keys and sunglasses when you walk through the door. To keep the space from ever looking cluttered, simply add a tray to contain the items you’ll drop there. Decorate it a bit with a vase or frame and it will look complete. This is one of the simplest ways to decorate a side table, by far, but also one of the most functional ways. Plus, it will keep other areas of your home, including the kitchen counter and coffee table, free from the items you tend to set there.&nbsp;</span></p><p class="sc-TtZnY fPBQTR pf-89_ avalon-demi" data-pf-type="Paragraph"><span data-pf-type="Text" class="sc-eGJWMs gQYBcx pf-88_">3.

This is the commandment of the one who’s looking for an almost too-pretty-to-touch look in their home. While not ideal for a nightstand, an end table near a chair that doesn’t get much use or by a sofa that has a coffee table to set things on may very well be able to function simply as a pretty place for pretty things. <br><br>To achieve this look, you can use any combination of decorative objects, picture frames, vases, books, candles, and more. Remember the stacking method and start with a large book or tray and then layer your other chosen items on top. Whether you opt for minimal or many layers is completely up to you. What matters is that you love the look of it in the end.&nbsp;</span></p><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2994/0144/t/185/assets/pf-6fab8f71--071721decoratesidetable04.jpg?v=1626557974" srcSet="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2994/0144/t/185/assets/pf-6fab8f71--071721decoratesidetable04.jpg?v=1626557974 1536w, https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2994/0144/t/185/assets/pf-6fab8f71--071721decoratesidetable04_500x.jpg?v=1626557974 320w" width="890" height="540" data-pf-type="Image" class="sc-carFqZ hBWCUB pf-59_"/><p class="sc-TtZnY fPBQTR pf-92_ avalon-demi" data-pf-type="Paragraph"><span data-pf-type="Text" class="sc-eGJWMs gQYBcx pf-91_">4.

That is, leaving the end table completely free from items. This may appeal to you for any number of reasons; perhaps the side table is where you set your coffee mug every morning, or your laptop when you need a break from your desk. Perhaps your style is minimalist, or perhaps you just love the look of your side table surface so much that you can’t bear to cover it up. If you opt for a surface design on your custom side table, we wouldn’t blame you if you choose to leave the surface free from any other decor.&nbsp;</span></p><p class="sc-TtZnY fPBQTR pf-101_ avalon-demi" data-pf-type="Paragraph"><span data-pf-type="Text" class="sc-eGJWMs gQYBcx pf-100_">5.

Use your side table as a place to display a plant or two from your collection. Not only will this help solve your problem, but it will also add life, texture, and color to the room. Should you choose to put more than one plant on your side table, we suggest choosing plants and pots of various heights and styles. You can always stack smaller plants on books to create the diversity of height as well. <br><br>Another great way to add life, texture, and color to any space is with flowers. Adding a vase of blooms will instantly brighten up the room.&nbsp;</span></p><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2994/0144/t/185/assets/pf-d375d5c7--071721sidetableheight02.jpg?v=1626556847" srcSet="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2994/0144/t/185/assets/pf-d375d5c7--071721sidetableheight02.jpg?v=1626556847 1536w, https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2994/0144/t/185/assets/pf-d375d5c7--071721sidetableheight02_500x.jpg?v=1626556847 320w" width="890" height="540" data-pf-type="Image" class="sc-carFqZ hBWCUB pf-102_"/><p class="sc-TtZnY fPBQTR pf-105_ avalon-demi" data-pf-type="Paragraph"><span data-pf-type="Text" class="sc-eGJWMs gQYBcx pf-104_">Embrace Your Style</span></p><p class="sc-TtZnY fPBQTR pf-108_" data-pf-type="Paragraph"><span data-pf-type="Text" class="sc-eGJWMs gQYBcx pf-107_">The size, shape, look, and placement of your side table will dictate how you decorate it, so styling your side table truly begins the moment you select it.
