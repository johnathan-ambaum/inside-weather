You can make the most of this small office floor plan by putting storage in the under side of the sloped steps. You can install a folding wall unit which you can stow away outside of work hours, or a narrow desk to make sure you’re not blocking any pathways. We also suggest placing an area rug in your converted small office space to help create a designated visual zone and distinguish your work space from the rest of the floor plan. The same goes for converting unused hallway space into a productive workspace. For this option, we would also go for a floating desk or a folding wall desk to help keep the space as open as possible. To help the hallway desk blend in, you can paint it the same shade as the wall and use decor such as a gallery wall or mirror to draw your eye up and away from the desk.<br><br>These routes may not be ideal for someone who needs to focus, host meetings, or who may not want to work out in the open, however this small home office layout idea is a great option to make the most of an awkward unused space.<br></span></p><div class="sc-hHEiqL ccTnQh pf-30_ pf-r pf-r-eh" style="--s-xs:15px" data-pf-type="Row"><div class="pf-c" style="--c-xs:12;--c-lg:12"><div data-pf-type="Column" class="sc-laZMeE ljWfRO pf-31_"><h3 data-pf-type="Heading" class="sc-ciSkZP hNMEMQ pf-32_ avalon-demi"><span data-pf-type="Text" class="sc-daBunf eQUdeu pf-34_">Turn a Closet into an Office</span></h3><p class="sc-fbIWvP fkBHIM pf-35_" data-pf-type="Paragraph"><span data-pf-type="Text" class="sc-daBunf eQUdeu pf-37_">If you are in tight quarters but can find a closet to spare, this is another great space to explore when considering options for small office layouts. You can remove shelving, racks and closet organization components to create a blank canvas for your supplies. We suggest using a narrow, low profile desk with shelving above to make room for computers, books, a printer, or anything else you may need. You can use white paint or a vibrant accent color to spice up your space and create depth. An unused closet has major office area potential as you can create your own little oasis.The best part about this small home office layout option is that when it is time to quit working and hit the hay in your comfy <a href="https://insideweather.com/pages/mattress" target="_self" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); text-decoration-line: underline;">hybrid mattress</a>, closing the curtains or shutting the door keeps the office out of sight, and out of mind.<br></span></p></div></div></div><h3 data-pf-type="Heading" class="sc-ciSkZP hNMEMQ pf-38_ avalon-demi"><span data-pf-type="Text" class="sc-daBunf eQUdeu pf-40_">Divide a Room into Two</span></h3><p class="sc-fbIWvP fkBHIM pf-41_" data-pf-type="Paragraph"><span data-pf-type="Text" class="sc-daBunf eQUdeu pf-43_">When experimenting with <a style="color:#202020; text-decoration:underline;" href="https://insideweather.com/blogs/the-weather-report/how-to-create-your-dream-home-office">home office layout ideas</a> for your small space, you can use a room divider to separate a larger room into two designated zones. If you do not want a visible room divider such as a curtain or a panel, you can use your sofa as a way to separate the space. Parking a desk right behind your sofa is a great way to maximize your space, but keeps the room looking open and as spacious as possible. If you take this route, you should use leggy furniture without visual heft to avoid that claustrophobic feeling. We also suggest using a desk in a similar tone as your sofa or in a light tone to help draw the eye up.

People are often inclined to make timid design choices in a small space. They often feel that the space is small so everything in it should be small, including decisions about color and design considerations, right? Wrong. Sure you can't put a massive desk in a small nook, but that doesn't mean you have to go with a tiny timid desk and no color. Small spaces require more focus and design energy than large spaces because every single inch counts when you're appointing a tiny space. So remember to consider adding your favorite pops of color, decor that brings you joy, and a small house plant so that your space feels grounded in a look that you ultimately love and makes you want to spend time there every day!<br></span></p><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2994/0144/t/185/assets/pf-92d207d1--031121blog08tinyworkspace05.jpg?v=1615506471" srcSet="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2994/0144/t/185/assets/pf-92d207d1--031121blog08tinyworkspace05.jpg?v=1615506471 1536w, https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2994/0144/t/185/assets/pf-92d207d1--031121blog08tinyworkspace05_500x.jpg?v=1615506471 320w" sizes="(min-width: 1536px) 1536px, (min-width: 1024px) and (max-width: 1535px) 1280px, (min-width: 640px) and (max-width: 1023px) 768px, 320px" data-pf-type="Image" class="sc-iBzEeX glZmJR pf-86_"/><p class="sc-fbIWvP fkBHIM pf-87_" data-pf-type="Paragraph"><span data-pf-type="Text" class="sc-daBunf eQUdeu pf-89_">Every small workspace and its occupants have different needs, so your small office layout should be treated in a way that caters to your own personal preferences. Make sure to round up all of your options, and utilize the space that you will be able to make the most of, and feel most productive in. Introducing elements of color, good lighting for work and play, and purging unnecessary clutter will go a long way towards creating an effective and enjoyable small workspace that might just turn out a lot better than you’d ever dreamed of!<br></span></p></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div data-pf-type="Section" class="sc-hhIiOg iwisNA pf-90_"><div style="--cw:1170px" class="sc-oeezt OJJCp"><div class="sc-hHEiqL ccTnQh pf-91_ pf-r pf-r-eh" style="--s-xs:15px" data-pf-type="Row"><div class="pf-c" style="--c-xs:12;--c-lg:12"><div data-pf-type="Column" class="sc-laZMeE ljWfRO pf-92_"><h3 data-pf-type="Heading" class="sc-ciSkZP hNMEMQ pf-93_ avalon-medium"><a data-link="inherit" href="https://insideweather.com/pages/blog" target="_self"><span data-pf-type="Text" class="sc-daBunf eQUdeu pf-95_"><span style="text-decoration-line: underline;">BACK to The Weather Report →</span></span></a></h3></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><script>window.__pagefly_setting__={"baseURL":"https://apps.pagefly.io","analyticsURL":"https://analytics.pagefly.io","isBackend":false,"cdnURL":"https://cdn.pagefly.io","pageflyVersion":"3.3.0","shopDomain":"loomandloft.myshopify.com","elementData":{},"pageTitle":"How to Make the Most of your Tiny Workspace","pageType":"blog","pageId":"a8c9c7a7-9148-45c7-93cc-dd0e08fa6648","lazyLoad":false,"forceByPassGoogleLightHouse":false,"imageLazyLoad":false,"nativeImageLazyLoad":true,"useThemeJQ":false,"fontLink":"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Barlow:wght@400;600&family=Roboto:wght@300;400&display=swap","trackingIDs":[],"shopifyProxyPath":"/a/pf_preview"};window.__pagefly_setting__.moneyFormat={{shop.money_format|json}};</script><script src="https://cdn.pagefly.io/pagefly/3.3.0/core/helper.js" defer></script> </article>
