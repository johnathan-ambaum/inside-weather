This space should feel tranquil, serve as a place to cozy up with a book, zone out and watch TV, or to simply lay down and relax. Alone time is very important, and it can be difficult to come by, especially if you have a busy job, a hectic schedule, or a large family so it is important to take advantage of the time you have.<br><br>There is arguably no space more important than the bedroom within your home. Read on to discover the 7 tips we have for creating a dreamy updated bedroom retreat.</span></p><p class="sc-fXazdy ujFwY pf-20_ avalon-demi" data-pf-type="Paragraph"><span data-pf-type="Text" class="sc-gsWcmt grZHMV pf-22_">1. Declutter Your Space</span></p><p class="sc-fXazdy ujFwY pf-23_" data-pf-type="Paragraph"><span data-pf-type="Text" class="sc-gsWcmt grZHMV pf-25_">Just because guests in your home don’t usually see your master bedroom doesn't mean that it can be cluttered and out of sorts. In fact, continuing to keep the room uncluttered is critical for a relaxing, serene atmosphere. Regardless of how small or large your bedroom, you should devise a way to corral your belongings and create an uncluttered visual appeal. This is especially true if closet storage space is limited and you’re keeping a lot of belongings in the bedroom area. There are many storage space options you can look into to help declutter and stay organized. We suggest also taking a few minutes out to tidy your bedroom every morning - the tidying may not be the most relaxing thing you do in the room, but coming home to a clean room will let you maximize your peaceful time at the end of the day.</span></p><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2994/0144/t/185/assets/pf-09a127c4--070921bedroomretreat01.jpg?v=1625874326" srcSet="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2994/0144/t/185/assets/pf-09a127c4--070921bedroomretreat01.jpg?v=1625874326 1536w, https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2994/0144/t/185/assets/pf-09a127c4--070921bedroomretreat01_500x.jpg?v=1625874326 320w" data-pf-type="Image" class="sc-ciSkZP bwSYJA pf-26_"/><p class="sc-fXazdy ujFwY pf-27_ avalon-demi" data-pf-type="Paragraph"><span data-pf-type="Text" class="sc-gsWcmt grZHMV pf-29_">2. Use Clean And Crisp Bedding</span></p><p class="sc-fXazdy ujFwY pf-30_" data-pf-type="Paragraph"><span data-pf-type="Text" class="sc-gsWcmt grZHMV pf-32_">Many people experience poor sleep a few nights a week and when reading about ways to improve on our sleep, we usually find remedies such as reducing screen time, meditation and introducing fragrances into the bedroom, but have you ever thought about what role your bedsheets play in all of this? Changing your bedding is a bedroom idea that can have a huge significant impact on the visual appeal and the tranquility of your master bedroom. <br><br> Several factors play into this, such as material, thread count, and how often you wash and change your bedding. If you’re asking yourself why does material matter when it comes to bedding, then think about it this way, you spend a third of your life in bed with your bedsheets. When you understand this, material becomes a little more important, but you should still keep in mind that personal preference plays a big role.<br><br>Below are some of the most popular choices for bedding material:</span></p><ul style="--text-indent:0;--line-spacing:10px" data-pf-type="List" class="sc-ckTSus kVjkXt pf-33_"><li data-pf-type="List.Item" class="sc-fbIWvP jREztg pf-34_"><span data-pf-type="Text" class="sc-gsWcmt grZHMV pf-36_"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Polycotton: </span>Made from a blend of polyester and cotton. While bed linen made out of a polycotton blend will still feel soft on the skin, it is not up to par with natural materials such as linen and cotton. Sheets made from polycotton blends usually come with a lower price tag and tend to be wrinkle-free after washing and tumble drying. That being said, they may not suit everyone’s personal needs, especially those who are concerned with living in a more sustainable lifestyle.&nbsp;</span></li><li data-pf-type="List.Item" class="sc-fbIWvP jREztg pf-37_"><span data-pf-type="Text" class="sc-gsWcmt grZHMV pf-39_"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Egyptian cotton: </span>Due to its extra-long fibers, Egyptian cotton is known to be resistant to surface pilling unlike other types of cotton. Egyptian cotton is renowned for being the best cotton in the world. When it comes to Egyptian cotton, think luxury hotels. They will more often than not use Egyptian cotton due to its ability to maintain a fresh crispy feeling over a long extended period of time, an, more importantly, even after countless washes.&nbsp;</span></li><li data-pf-type="List.Item" class="sc-fbIWvP jREztg pf-40_"><span data-pf-type="Text" class="sc-gsWcmt grZHMV pf-42_"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Linen: </span>Linen has always been a top contender when it comes to bedding. It is widely recognized for being naturally luxurious, and although it feels a little rougher than cotton the first time you settle for a night of sleep, it will soon soften up and continue to do so after every single wash. Linen is bacteria resistant so it is also an excellent choice for anyone suffering from allergies or sensitive skin. It is very strong and absorbent and dries much faster than cotton which also makes it a popular choice of bedding material in warmer climates because it will help keep you cool.</span></li></ul><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2994/0144/t/185/assets/pf-451c5810--070921bedroomretreat02.jpg?v=1625874523" srcSet="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2994/0144/t/185/assets/pf-451c5810--070921bedroomretreat02.jpg?v=1625874523 1536w, https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2994/0144/t/185/assets/pf-451c5810--070921bedroomretreat02_500x.jpg?v=1625874523 320w" data-pf-type="Image" class="sc-ciSkZP bwSYJA pf-43_"/><p class="sc-fXazdy ujFwY pf-44_" data-pf-type="Paragraph"><span data-pf-type="Text" class="sc-gsWcmt grZHMV pf-46_">Next up on the list is thread count. Simply put, the thread count is the number of vertical and horizontal threads woven into fabric per square inch. Over the years, manufacturers have claimed that higher thread count equals better quality, but experts have concluded that it’s not always the case. What matters most when looking at thread count is the fiber itself: meaning if you opt for good quality fiber with a lower thread count, it will last longer and feel softer than high thread count but with low-quality fiber bedding.<br><br>Lastly, once you’ve made up your mind on which type of bedding you want to bring into your home, you will need to remember that when you settle in for a good night’s sleep, you’ll want to be in clean sheets. As a general rule you should wash your sheets once a week or at least every two weeks. This will maximize that crisp clean feeling and allow you to sleep more comfortably.&nbsp;</span></p><p class="sc-fXazdy ujFwY pf-47_ avalon-demi" data-pf-type="Paragraph"><span data-pf-type="Text" class="sc-gsWcmt grZHMV pf-49_">3. Invest In A Good Mattress</span></p><p class="sc-fXazdy ujFwY pf-50_" data-pf-type="Paragraph"><span data-pf-type="Text" class="sc-gsWcmt grZHMV pf-52_">Mattresses provide the foundation for a good night’s sleep and choosing the right one can make all the difference when it comes to comfort and waking up refreshed in the morning. Mattresses may not be the most exciting topic of discussion, and for many, a mattress is just an afterthought; something that doesn’t require much attention, unlike bedding and pillows, which can dictate your room’s overall design and aesthetic. Selecting a mattress and knowing how to choose the right mattress should, however, be at the forefront of your design process as it is essential to a good night’s sleep. When buying a new mattress, make sure you do some extensive research. You can check out our tips on how to select the best mattress here.&nbsp;</span></p><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2994/0144/t/185/assets/pf-1085b376--070921bedroomretreat03.jpg?v=1625874630" srcSet="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2994/0144/t/185/assets/pf-1085b376--070921bedroomretreat03.jpg?v=1625874630 1536w, https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2994/0144/t/185/assets/pf-1085b376--070921bedroomretreat03_500x.jpg?v=1625874630 320w" data-pf-type="Image" class="sc-ciSkZP bwSYJA pf-53_"/><p class="sc-fXazdy ujFwY pf-54_ avalon-demi" data-pf-type="Paragraph"><span data-pf-type="Text" class="sc-gsWcmt grZHMV pf-56_">4. Use Calming Colors</span></p><p class="sc-fXazdy ujFwY pf-57_" data-pf-type="Paragraph"><span data-pf-type="Text" class="sc-gsWcmt grZHMV pf-59_">The bedroom is your sanctuary for serenity and should promote soothing vibes. One of the best interior design methods to achieve this cozy, calm ambiance in your bedroom design is through the use of color, and colors can have a larger impact on your sleep than you’d think. You’ll want to choose cool hues because these shades are known to reduce stress and anxiety, promote relaxation, and even make your floor space seem more expansive. Some of the best colors to feature in your bedroom decor are white, pale blue, soft green, lavender and light gray. When incorporated in an accent wall or wallpaper, throw pillow cases, bedroom furniture pieces, or curtains, all of these hues are said to promote soothing feelings, decrease anxiety, and have deep calming vibes.</span></p><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2994/0144/t/185/assets/pf-85b3760a--070921bedroomretreat04.jpg?v=1625874642" srcSet="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2994/0144/t/185/assets/pf-85b3760a--070921bedroomretreat04.jpg?v=1625874642 1536w, https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2994/0144/t/185/assets/pf-85b3760a--070921bedroomretreat04_500x.jpg?v=1625874642 320w" data-pf-type="Image" class="sc-ciSkZP bwSYJA pf-60_"/><p class="sc-fXazdy ujFwY pf-61_ avalon-demi" data-pf-type="Paragraph"><span data-pf-type="Text" class="sc-gsWcmt grZHMV pf-63_">5.

When you finally make it into your bedroom after a long day and want to unwind, the levels of light can have a great impact on how long it will take you to drift off into a sound slumber. Both your eyes and your mind need time to adjust and going from a bright light into sudden pitch-black darkness is not the most efficient way to transfer over into sleep. One way to avoid this is by installing a dimmer switch.
