At Inside Weather, we spent a lot of time and energy crafting the perfect hybrid mattress at the right price. The result? An affordable, non-toxic, hybrid mattress with a quilted cooling top and a supportive memory foam layer over 6 inches of individually-encased coils. \u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003eIn terms of firmness level, our mattress sits right about in the middle-- it’s more supportive than a pillow top or memory foam mattress, but more plush than a traditional innerspring mattress. Its inch and a half of quilted cooling top sucks away body heat so you have more ZZZs and fewer warm nights. Beneath that, the breathable memory foam ensures a comfortable sleeping surface while minimizing motion transfer. Plus, it’s manufactured in the USA and Certi-Pur certified, so you can rest easy knowing your new mattress type is free and clear of allergenic chemicals.
