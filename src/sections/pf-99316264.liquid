Take a seat for conversation with friends and family, enjoy a morning cup of coffee, or simply sit and do some work while you’re cooking dinner. <br><br>Though it would be handy, unfortunately, there isn’t an industry standard for the heights of bar stools and countertops. That means that choosing the right stool height for your counter can be challenging, to say the least. So, how do you choose stool height?<br><br>Measurements are key, along with some other considerations you may want to think about before purchasing. Ultimately, you want seating that’s comfy and that looks good, without being too tall, too short, or too bulky for your space.&nbsp;</span></p><p class="sc-TtZnY fPBQTR pf-20_ avalon-demi" data-pf-type="Paragraph"><span data-pf-type="Text" class="sc-eGJWMs gQYBcx pf-22_">What is a Counter Stool?</span></p><p class="sc-TtZnY fPBQTR pf-23_" data-pf-type="Paragraph"><span data-pf-type="Text" class="sc-eGJWMs gQYBcx pf-25_">A <a href="https://insideweather.com/products/rc101110af-latte-sarno-counter-stool-in-cloud" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); text-decoration-line: underline;">counter stool</a> is designed to provide something similar to restaurant seating, allowing you to sit behind a counter comfortably, without it being too high or too low. Nothing like banging your knees because the stool is the wrong height!<br><br>Counter stools are multi-purpose and can be used not only for counters, but also for high kitchen table tops, high dining tables, and more. So, counter stools need to be tall enough to allow people to reach the surface comfortably while sitting down, yet also provide ample leg space.&nbsp;</span></p><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2994/0144/t/185/assets/pf-8692ef75--071821stoolheight01.jpg?v=1626632166" srcSet="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2994/0144/t/185/assets/pf-8692ef75--071821stoolheight01.jpg?v=1626632166 1536w, https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2994/0144/t/185/assets/pf-8692ef75--071821stoolheight01_500x.jpg?v=1626632166 320w" width="890" height="540" data-pf-type="Image" class="sc-carFqZ hBWCUB pf-60_"/><p class="sc-TtZnY fPBQTR pf-26_ avalon-demi" data-pf-type="Paragraph"><span data-pf-type="Text" class="sc-eGJWMs gQYBcx pf-28_">Counter Height Countertops</span></p><p class="sc-TtZnY fPBQTR pf-29_" data-pf-type="Paragraph"><span data-pf-type="Text" class="sc-eGJWMs gQYBcx pf-31_">A counter height space for dining increases the size of your workspace when the counter is not being used for serving. Wider counters are especially helpful to serve buffet meals or fancy spreads for a cocktail party. A continuous countertop makes the room appear larger and more spacious than it actually is. It’s also at a height that’s easy to access for adults and children alike.&nbsp;</span></p><p class="sc-TtZnY fPBQTR pf-48_ avalon-demi" data-pf-type="Paragraph"><span data-pf-type="Text" class="sc-eGJWMs gQYBcx pf-50_">How to Choose Counter Stool Height</span></p><p class="sc-TtZnY fPBQTR pf-51_" data-pf-type="Paragraph"><span data-pf-type="Text" class="sc-eGJWMs gQYBcx pf-53_">Normally, counter stools feature a height of anywhere between 24 to 27 inches. Mostly because a countertop’s height is typically around 36 to 39 inches from the floor. A stool that measures between 24 to 27 inches provides enough space between the counter and seat to fit your legs comfortably and make movement easy, while also putting you at the perfect height to utilize the counter without any weird reaching like you’ve got dinosaur arms. <br><br>Counter stools are measured from the floor to the seat. As a general rule of thumb, there should be a difference of about 10 inches between the underside of the counter and the counter stool seat. This is important to remember, especially if your counter height doesn’t fit with the dimensions we just mentioned.</span></p><p class="sc-TtZnY fPBQTR pf-54_ avalon-demi" data-pf-type="Paragraph"><span data-pf-type="Text" class="sc-eGJWMs gQYBcx pf-56_">What is a Bar Stool?</span></p><p class="sc-TtZnY fPBQTR pf-57_" data-pf-type="Paragraph"><span data-pf-type="Text" class="sc-eGJWMs gQYBcx pf-59_">A <a href="https://insideweather.com/products/rb101210af-latte-sarno-bar-stool-in-cloud" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); text-decoration-line: underline;">bar stool</a> is, simply put, a tall chair designed with footrests to provide support, both for chair stability and your feet and legs. Initially, bar stools were used exclusively at bars, hence the name. However, nowadays some people like to use bar stools at their kitchen counters, especially if they are on the higher side. Traditionally, bar stools feature a narrow width, with a tall frame to allow people to comfortably reach bar height.&nbsp;</span></p><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2994/0144/t/185/assets/pf-92ef753a--071821stoolheight02.jpg?v=1626632271" srcSet="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2994/0144/t/185/assets/pf-92ef753a--071821stoolheight02.jpg?v=1626632271 1536w, https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2994/0144/t/185/assets/pf-92ef753a--071821stoolheight02_500x.jpg?v=1626632271 320w" width="890" height="540" data-pf-type="Image" class="sc-carFqZ hBWCUB pf-125_"/><p class="sc-TtZnY fPBQTR pf-61_ avalon-demi" data-pf-type="Paragraph"><span data-pf-type="Text" class="sc-eGJWMs gQYBcx pf-63_">How to Choose Bar Stool Height?</span></p><p class="sc-TtZnY fPBQTR pf-64_" data-pf-type="Paragraph"><span data-pf-type="Text" class="sc-eGJWMs gQYBcx pf-66_">The seat height––and width––of bar stools are determined by the height of the bar they’re paired with. However, the typical height for a bar stool seat is measured to be between 29 and 30 inches from the floor. This is designed in accordance with a typical bar height that ranges from 40 to 42 inches. <br><br>This gap of roughly 10 inches allows people to sit comfortably without trapping their knees between the counter and seat or causing themselves unnecessary pain. Similar to counter stools, bar stools are also measured from the floor to the seat.&nbsp;</span></p><p class="sc-TtZnY fPBQTR pf-67_ avalon-demi" data-pf-type="Paragraph"><span data-pf-type="Text" class="sc-eGJWMs gQYBcx pf-69_">How to Determine Spacing for Counter and Bar Stools</span></p><p class="sc-TtZnY fPBQTR pf-70_" data-pf-type="Paragraph"><span data-pf-type="Text" class="sc-eGJWMs gQYBcx pf-72_">Another important factor to consider before investing in  stools is the gap between your stools and the counter––will they stay pushed against the counter or tucked up under?––plus the number of stools you want to place at your counter.<br><br>You need space between each of the stools to allow people to move their arms while eating or drinking, or getting on and off the stool. The ideal space for a stool that measures 16 to 18 inches wide is around 22 inches per stool. That means that the gap between two stools should be at least 6 inches. <br><br>For kitchen stools that measure 19 to 22 inches in width, they’ll require space of about 24 to 25 inches per stool. From this, you can deduce that the average gap required between stools will be 8 to 10 inches. For stool designs that feature arms, or swivel stools, you can reliably expect the gap to be increased by several inches.&nbsp;</span></p><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2994/0144/t/185/assets/pf-ef753a75--071821stoolheight03.jpg?v=1626632367" srcSet="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2994/0144/t/185/assets/pf-ef753a75--071821stoolheight03.jpg?v=1626632367 1536w, https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2994/0144/t/185/assets/pf-ef753a75--071821stoolheight03_500x.jpg?v=1626632367 320w" width="890" height="540" data-pf-type="Image" class="sc-carFqZ hBWCUB pf-79_"/><p class="sc-TtZnY fPBQTR pf-73_ avalon-demi" data-pf-type="Paragraph"><span data-pf-type="Text" class="sc-eGJWMs gQYBcx pf-75_">Types of Bar and Counter Stools</span></p><ul style="--text-indent:0;--line-spacing:10px" data-pf-type="List" class="sc-FRrlG cIjgB pf-32_"><li data-pf-type="List.Item" class="sc-fXazdy UjHkE pf-143_"><span data-pf-type="Text" class="sc-eGJWMs gQYBcx pf-142_"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Leather Stools: </span>These stools are low-maintenance and ideal for informal settings.

The biggest benefit of backless stools is that they can slide under the counter completely, freeing up space when they’re not in use. This makes them ideal for smaller kitchen and dining areas. However, they don’t provide any support and may not be good for sitting for longer periods of time.&nbsp;</span></li><li data-pf-type="List.Item" class="sc-fXazdy UjHkE pf-39_"><span data-pf-type="Text" class="sc-eGJWMs gQYBcx pf-41_"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Swivel:</span> These stools come with a rotating seat for convenience.

They are certainly a convenient choice! Not only can you customize the cushions whenever and however you want, but you can also adjust the padding.

That makes them great for kitchen counter stools, since the cushions can be replaced or washed separately if something is spilled on them.</span></li><li data-pf-type="List.Item" class="sc-fXazdy UjHkE pf-137_"><span data-pf-type="Text" class="sc-eGJWMs gQYBcx pf-136_"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Wooden Stools: </span>These stools are a classic choice for bars.
