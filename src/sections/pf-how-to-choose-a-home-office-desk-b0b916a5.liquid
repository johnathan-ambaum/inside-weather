First and foremost, you will need to decide where your home office will be located. Whether you’re upgrading from a cubicle to a private office or simply finding space in a spare bedroom or the living room, the desk you choose will be the difference between a productive workspace and an uninspiring one. If you do have a dedicated home office that does not have to double up as another space, you will have a lot more flexibility with your choice of desk. However, if you are making it work in another room of the house, the key furniture element within the space will be your choice of desk.<br><br>We have also laid out some key factors to take into consideration when sourcing your best work from home desk.<br> </span></p><div class="sc-dlMDgC kpPvTx pf-20_ pf-r pf-r-eh" style="--s-xs:15px" data-pf-type="Row"><div class="pf-c" style="--c-xs:12;--c-lg:12"><div data-pf-type="Column" class="sc-hTRkXV enlJuL pf-21_"><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2994/0144/t/185/assets/pf-2bb64d0a--blognumber01wht.png?v=1607717040" srcSet="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2994/0144/t/185/assets/pf-2bb64d0a--blognumber01wht.png?v=1607717040 1536w" data-pf-type="Image" class="sc-jJMGnK laKGqb pf-22_"/><h3 data-pf-type="Heading" class="sc-ezzafa qUTLf pf-23_ avalon-bold"><span data-pf-type="Text" class="sc-jUfyBS eSyZIh pf-25_">Layout &amp; Space</span></h3><p class="sc-lbVvki flSuVc pf-26_" data-pf-type="Paragraph"><span data-pf-type="Text" class="sc-jUfyBS eSyZIh pf-28_">In order to find a desk that meets all of your needs, you’ll have to ask yourself a few questions:<br><br>How much surface area do you need?<br>Do you use multiple monitors?<br>Do you need storage space?<br>Is your space restricted?<br><br>The answers to all of these questions will help guide you towards selecting a desk that best matches your specific needs and makes the most sense for your day-to-day work.

The overall number of hours you work should help inform the style of desk that will work best for you. For example, if you work 40+ hours a week you will want to make sure you have a desk and chair combination that you will be comfortable in for long periods of time. If you work shorter, more sporadic work hours you will have more leniency on the style of desk and chair you choose for your space. Style, location and lighting will all have a direct impact on the successes of your work days!<br></span></p></div></div><div class="pf-c" style="--c-xs:12;--c-sm:4;--c-lg:5"><div data-pf-type="Column" class="sc-hTRkXV enlJuL pf-41_"><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2994/0144/t/185/assets/pf-bea156c9--031121blog06chooseadesk02.jpg?v=1615496354" srcSet="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2994/0144/t/185/assets/pf-bea156c9--031121blog06chooseadesk02.jpg?v=1615496354 1536w" data-pf-type="Image" class="sc-jJMGnK laKGqb pf-42_"/></div></div></div></div></div></div><div class="sc-dlMDgC kpPvTx pf-43_ pf-r pf-r-eh" style="--s-xs:15px" data-pf-type="Row"><div class="pf-c" style="--c-xs:12;--c-lg:12"><div data-pf-type="Column" class="sc-hTRkXV enlJuL pf-44_"><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2994/0144/t/185/assets/pf-fde2ac7a--blognumber03wht.png?v=1607717467" srcSet="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2994/0144/t/185/assets/pf-fde2ac7a--blognumber03wht.png?v=1607717467 1536w" data-pf-type="Image" class="sc-jJMGnK laKGqb pf-45_"/><h3 data-pf-type="Heading" class="sc-ezzafa qUTLf pf-46_ avalon-bold"><span data-pf-type="Text" class="sc-jUfyBS eSyZIh pf-48_">Types of Desks</span></h3><ul style="--text-indent:0px;--line-spacing:10px" data-pf-type="List" class="sc-oeezt OJJCp pf-49_"><li data-pf-type="List.Item" class="sc-hhIiOg iwisNA pf-50_"><span data-pf-type="Text" class="sc-jUfyBS eSyZIh pf-52_"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Corner Desk:</span> Corner desks are a great option for larger offices or for when you want to have extra work space. Intended to maximize corners and angles, these desks come in a variety of styles and sizes. They are generally on the larger more heavy-duty side, however you can definitely find smaller options for more compact spaces.</span></li><li data-pf-type="List.Item" class="sc-hhIiOg iwisNA pf-53_"><span data-pf-type="Text" class="sc-jUfyBS eSyZIh pf-55_"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Credenza Desk:</span> A Credenza desk is often used as a secondary workspace. This desk can be used with an executive or computer desk, allowing for maximum surface area and storage. In addition to a flat surface, a credenza may contain cabinets, shelves, drawers, and a filing area.</span></li><li data-pf-type="List.Item" class="sc-hhIiOg iwisNA pf-56_"><span data-pf-type="Text" class="sc-jUfyBS eSyZIh pf-58_"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Executive Desk:</span> Executive desks are commonly used in large offices with ample space to spare.

These desks free up valuable floor space and allow for a nice streamlined finish. They have no legs, so it is not wise to store heavy objects on them. Some of them fold down, while others are permanently mounted so they protrude from the wall at all times. They typically have a drop-down desktop or a built-in storage system with an integrated surface for laptops or monitors. A floating desk is a great choice if you are looking for a space saving option!&nbsp;</span></li><li data-pf-type="List.Item" class="sc-hhIiOg iwisNA pf-62_"><span data-pf-type="Text" class="sc-jUfyBS eSyZIh pf-64_"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Folding Desk:</span> Folding desks are great for temporary desk needs or desks that need to be moved around often.

Secretary desks have an upper board that folds down to form a writing surface. It typically hides little cubbies and drawers where small objects can be stored. When the surface is no longer needed, it folds back up for storage making this another great option for use in a common area of the home.</span></li><li data-pf-type="List.Item" class="sc-hhIiOg iwisNA pf-71_"><span data-pf-type="Text" class="sc-jUfyBS eSyZIh pf-73_"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Standing Desk:</span> Standing desks are a great option for those who work long hours and want to be able to stand and stretch throughout the work day.
