Whether it’s decorated or not, it can be both a beautiful statement piece and a practical asset in a living room, bedroom, playroom, any seating area, and even an entryway. If you’re still wondering “<a href="https://insideweather.com/blogs/the-weather-report/what-is-an-ottoman-used-for" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); text-decoration-line: underline;">What is an ottoman?</a>” We share everything you need to know.<br><br>Whether it serves as your coffee table or a place to set your feet, we’ll teach you how to decorate an ottoman so that it adds to your living area. These inspiring ideas will have you convinced of not just the necessity of an ottoman, but the necessity of one in every room.&nbsp;</span></p><p class="sc-TtZnY fPBQTR pf-20_ avalon-demi" data-pf-type="Paragraph"><span data-pf-type="Text" class="sc-eGJWMs gQYBcx pf-22_">Add a Tray&nbsp;</span></p><p class="sc-TtZnY fPBQTR pf-23_" data-pf-type="Paragraph"><span data-pf-type="Text" class="sc-eGJWMs gQYBcx pf-25_">Adding a tray is one of the best ways to decorate an <a href="https://insideweather.com/pages/ottomans" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); text-decoration-line: underline;">ottoman</a> because it creates a hard surface that is both functional and beautiful, especially if your ottoman is the centerpiece of your living room. Most ottomans are soft and covered in fabric, which means, they don’t function the same as a coffee table—you can’t set your coffee on it. Add a tray, though, and suddenly you can. Voilá!<br><br>Adding a tray is also a functional way to add a surface you can decorate. Considering that’s what this article is all about, we take it you like to decorate. A tray can hold all of your decorative objects and keep them from floating around the ottoman and rolling off. <br><br>   When shopping for a tray for your ottoman, choose a material that won’t scratch or snag the fabric when you move the tray around. Keep the size and shape of your ottoman in mind as well; a rectangle tray works on a rectangle ottoman, a square tray works on a square ottoman, and a round tray works on an ottoman that is round or square. Whatever shape you go with, the tray should take up at least half the surface area of the ottoman.&nbsp;</span></p><p class="sc-TtZnY fPBQTR pf-102_ avalon-demi" data-pf-type="Paragraph"><span data-pf-type="Text" class="sc-eGJWMs gQYBcx pf-101_">Adorn the Tray</span></p><p class="sc-TtZnY fPBQTR pf-99_" data-pf-type="Paragraph"><span data-pf-type="Text" class="sc-eGJWMs gQYBcx pf-98_">Once you’ve got a tray in place, you can easily add more decor to its flat surface. We love the look of a vase of flowers or a real live plant to add height, color, and life to the space, but there are plenty of other ways to adorn a tray too. Embrace any or all of these ideas:&nbsp;</span></p><ul style="--text-indent:0;--line-spacing:10px" data-pf-type="List" class="sc-FRrlG cIjgB pf-115_"><li data-pf-type="List.Item" class="sc-fXazdy UjHkE pf-105_"><span data-pf-type="Text" class="sc-eGJWMs gQYBcx pf-104_">Sculptural objects such as metal asterisks and orbs, wooden knots, glass beads, and all those funky-shaped things.</span></li><li data-pf-type="List.Item" class="sc-fXazdy UjHkE pf-108_"><span data-pf-type="Text" class="sc-eGJWMs gQYBcx pf-107_">Coffee table books.

For instance, each item of the same type can count as one i.e, three stacked books or two candlesticks. Small accessories can also be removed from the count such as coasters or beads, especially when set on top of books or magazines.&nbsp;</span></p><p class="sc-TtZnY fPBQTR pf-124_ avalon-demi" data-pf-type="Paragraph"><span data-pf-type="Text" class="sc-eGJWMs gQYBcx pf-123_">Display Magazines or Books&nbsp;</span></p><p class="sc-TtZnY fPBQTR pf-121_" data-pf-type="Paragraph"><span data-pf-type="Text" class="sc-eGJWMs gQYBcx pf-120_">Speaking of books and magazines… literature is a great way to decorate an ottoman. <br><br>Whether an ottoman acts as your coffee table or your side table or even a window seat, it can be a great place to display magazines or books. Stack them neatly or fan them out to cover more ground. As they come in all manners of shape, size, and style, it’s relatively easy to find magazines and books that match your space, whether they’re weathered and vintage, substantial and stylish, or vibrant and petite. Their beautiful covers and spines will add color and texture to the surface of your ottoman, and thus your entire space. Plus, when you’re lounging nearby, you can easily flip through their pages.&nbsp;</span></p><p class="sc-TtZnY fPBQTR pf-130_ avalon-demi" data-pf-type="Paragraph"><span data-pf-type="Text" class="sc-eGJWMs gQYBcx pf-129_">Create a Cozy Space</span></p><p class="sc-TtZnY fPBQTR pf-127_" data-pf-type="Paragraph"><span data-pf-type="Text" class="sc-eGJWMs gQYBcx pf-126_">The upholstered look of an ottoman makes it an inviting place already, so why not amp up the coziness with a throw or pillow or both? Throws and pillows will not only make an ottoman more inviting but also add texture that is visually appealing, making the entire room more pleasing to the eye.</span></p><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2994/0144/t/185/assets/pf-35d070e9--071221famfriendlylivingroom03.jpg?v=1626138310" srcSet="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2994/0144/t/185/assets/pf-35d070e9--071221famfriendlylivingroom03.jpg?v=1626138310 1536w, https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2994/0144/t/185/assets/pf-35d070e9--071221famfriendlylivingroom03_500x.jpg?v=1626138310 320w" width="890" height="540" data-pf-type="Image" class="sc-carFqZ hBWCUB pf-26_"/><p class="sc-TtZnY fPBQTR pf-136_ avalon-demi" data-pf-type="Paragraph"><span data-pf-type="Text" class="sc-eGJWMs gQYBcx pf-135_">Toss on a Throw</span></p><p class="sc-TtZnY fPBQTR pf-33_" data-pf-type="Paragraph"><span data-pf-type="Text" class="sc-eGJWMs gQYBcx pf-35_">A throw is a blanket that does double duty as both decor and a warming device. Simply grab it from the middle and toss it onto the ottoman for a relaxed, draped look, or fold it nicely and place it on the ottoman so it hangs evenly over each edge. It will not only look nice but also be within reach whenever anyone seeks its warmth.&nbsp;</span></p><p class="sc-TtZnY fPBQTR pf-30_ avalon-demi" data-pf-type="Paragraph"><span data-pf-type="Text" class="sc-eGJWMs gQYBcx pf-32_">Add Pillows</span></p><p class="sc-TtZnY fPBQTR pf-133_" data-pf-type="Paragraph"><span data-pf-type="Text" class="sc-eGJWMs gQYBcx pf-132_">If your ottoman is backed up against a wall, window, or bed, and primarily used for lounging, pillows can make the space even more opportune for relaxing. For a large ottoman or two ottomans set beside one another, add two <a href="https://insideweather.com/pages/pillows" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); text-decoration-line: underline;">throw pillows</a> to create a sofa-like back to the seat. Inviting, now, isn’t it? Add a book or two as we mentioned above to make the space even more difficult to leave.&nbsp;</span></p><p class="sc-TtZnY fPBQTR pf-142_ avalon-demi" data-pf-type="Paragraph"><span data-pf-type="Text" class="sc-eGJWMs gQYBcx pf-141_">Leave it Bare&nbsp;</span></p><p class="sc-TtZnY fPBQTR pf-139_" data-pf-type="Paragraph"><span data-pf-type="Text" class="sc-eGJWMs gQYBcx pf-138_">You don’t actually have to decorate an ottoman at all. That’s right, this fabric-covered piece of furniture is beautiful as is, and can function, sometimes better, if it’s not decorated at all. If it’s acting as your one and only coffee table in the room, you may want to skip this suggestion, but if you have other surfaces where you can set a beverage or a decorative box, why not save yourself the time and trouble and let it alone? Here are three instances, in particular, where it makes sense to leave an ottoman bare.&nbsp;</span></p><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2994/0144/t/185/assets/pf-b69d05d4--071721decorateottoman01.jpg?v=1626561117" srcSet="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2994/0144/t/185/assets/pf-b69d05d4--071721decorateottoman01.jpg?v=1626561117 1536w, https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2994/0144/t/185/assets/pf-b69d05d4--071721decorateottoman01_500x.jpg?v=1626561117 320w" width="890" height="540" data-pf-type="Image" class="sc-carFqZ hBWCUB pf-36_"/><p class="sc-TtZnY fPBQTR pf-37_ avalon-demi" data-pf-type="Paragraph"><span data-pf-type="Text" class="sc-eGJWMs gQYBcx pf-39_">When an Ottoman is Additional Seating&nbsp;</span></p><p class="sc-TtZnY fPBQTR pf-40_" data-pf-type="Paragraph"><span data-pf-type="Text" class="sc-eGJWMs gQYBcx pf-42_">An ottoman can serve many purposes, one of which is providing additional seating in a room. If you plan to use an ottoman for seating often, whether you’re an avid entertainer or it simply serves the room’s layout well, it’s best to leave it bare. This way, you won’t have to move anything on top of it to make space for someone to sit. Instead, the blank space will invite them to take a seat and stay awhile.&nbsp;</span></p><p class="sc-TtZnY fPBQTR pf-43_ avalon-demi" data-pf-type="Paragraph"><span data-pf-type="Text" class="sc-eGJWMs gQYBcx pf-45_">When an Ottoman is a Foot Stool</span></p><p class="sc-TtZnY fPBQTR pf-46_" data-pf-type="Paragraph"><span data-pf-type="Text" class="sc-eGJWMs gQYBcx pf-48_">An ottoman’s original purpose is as a footstool, which is another reason to keep it free from clutter. If it’s going to function as a place to set your feet, the ottoman should have plenty of room for you to do so. This is also a good idea if you have a piece with a fluid structure such as our <a href="https://insideweather.com/products/sp11an-latte-spring-ottoman-in-cloud" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); text-decoration-line: underline;">Spring Ottoman</a>.
