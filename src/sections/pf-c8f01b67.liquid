Yes, obviously they’re for sitting, but not all sitting is the same! For example, if you plan to use the chair for reading or to watch TV, the chair needs to be cushy and comfy. In that case, you might want to avoid chairs with straight backs, or chairs with metal frames, or chairs with no cushions. <br><br>If the goal is reading and watching TV, or enjoying a cup of coffee with a pal, the ideal chair would be a comfortable one with armrests and plush back cushions, like a <a href="https://insideweather.com/pages/lounge-chairs" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); text-decoration-line: underline;">lounge chair</a>, barrel chair or a wingback chair. That way you can sit for long periods of time and enjoy yourself, sans the back aches. If you’re looking to add a chair to your bedroom, we provide plenty of inspiration for <a href="https://insideweather.com/blogs/the-weather-report/bedroom-corner-chair-ideas-tips" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); text-decoration-line: underline;">bedroom corner chair ideas</a>.</span></p><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2994/0144/t/185/assets/pf-b4f64f94--071821livingroomchairs01.jpg?v=1626633242" srcSet="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2994/0144/t/185/assets/pf-b4f64f94--071821livingroomchairs01.jpg?v=1626633242 1536w, https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2994/0144/t/185/assets/pf-b4f64f94--071821livingroomchairs01_500x.jpg?v=1626633242 320w" width="890" height="540" data-pf-type="Image" class="sc-carFqZ hBWCUB pf-60_"/><p class="sc-TtZnY fPBQTR pf-29_" data-pf-type="Paragraph"><span data-pf-type="Text" class="sc-eGJWMs gQYBcx pf-31_">However, if the purpose of your chair is to garner attention and perhaps draw the eye to a killer piece of art on the background wall, its color and style will matter a whole lot more than how cushy it is.<br><br>By determining how you’ll use the chair, it can help you choose the right chair that fulfills the purpose. It also helps inform your other choices, like fabric, style, comfort, and durability.</span></p><p class="sc-TtZnY fPBQTR pf-48_ avalon-demi" data-pf-type="Paragraph"><span data-pf-type="Text" class="sc-eGJWMs gQYBcx pf-50_">Placement&nbsp;</span></p><p class="sc-TtZnY fPBQTR pf-51_" data-pf-type="Paragraph"><span data-pf-type="Text" class="sc-eGJWMs gQYBcx pf-53_">Another thing to consider when choosing chairs for your living room is the placement and seating arrangement. Your location choices affect the style and the design of the chair you will need.<br><br>For example, if the chair will be placed near the breakfast nook or dining table as an extra seat, you probably need a chair with an upright back, and the right height that’s comparable to your other dining chairs and table. That way anyone that uses it can join the table and sit with comfort. If you’re looking to elevate your existing breakfast nook, we share <a href="https://insideweather.com/blogs/the-weather-report/how-to-decorate-a-breakfast-bar" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); text-decoration-line: underline;">how to decorate a breakfast bar</a>.<br><br>However, if you just want to add to the seating options in your living room, you will need a chair that complements your other furniture and adds to the style and theme of your living room.<br><br>So, knowing where you want to put your new living room chair and knowing what you’ll be using it for is pretty key in choosing the right chair.</span></p><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2994/0144/t/185/assets/pf-f64f9441--071821livingroomchairs02.jpg?v=1626633343" srcSet="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2994/0144/t/185/assets/pf-f64f9441--071821livingroomchairs02.jpg?v=1626633343 1536w, https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2994/0144/t/185/assets/pf-f64f9441--071821livingroomchairs02_500x.jpg?v=1626633343 320w" width="890" height="540" data-pf-type="Image" class="sc-carFqZ hBWCUB pf-152_"/><p class="sc-TtZnY fPBQTR pf-54_ avalon-demi" data-pf-type="Paragraph"><span data-pf-type="Text" class="sc-eGJWMs gQYBcx pf-56_">Chair Size</span></p><p class="sc-TtZnY fPBQTR pf-57_" data-pf-type="Paragraph"><span data-pf-type="Text" class="sc-eGJWMs gQYBcx pf-59_">When you know where you are going to place your new chair, you probably already have an idea of what size your chair should be. However, even if you can afford more spacious chairs, you need to envision the chair getting along with the size and scale of the existing furniture in the room, besides fitting the room itself.&nbsp;</span></p><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2994/0144/t/185/assets/pf-9441b469--071821livingroomchairs03.jpg?v=1626633416" srcSet="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2994/0144/t/185/assets/pf-9441b469--071821livingroomchairs03.jpg?v=1626633416 1536w, https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2994/0144/t/185/assets/pf-9441b469--071821livingroomchairs03_500x.jpg?v=1626633416 320w" width="890" height="540" data-pf-type="Image" class="sc-carFqZ hBWCUB pf-153_"/><p class="sc-TtZnY fPBQTR pf-64_" data-pf-type="Paragraph"><span data-pf-type="Text" class="sc-eGJWMs gQYBcx pf-66_">You can use a measuring tape to measure your existing furniture, pinning down specifically the height of the back and the seat. You can use those measurements when considering what chair you want.<br><br>The rule of thumb is to maintain a breathing space of approximately 18 inches between your chair and a center table. A space of roughly two feet is also recommended by some designers, so you can comfortably walk around the chair.</span></p><p class="sc-TtZnY fPBQTR pf-67_ avalon-demi" data-pf-type="Paragraph"><span data-pf-type="Text" class="sc-eGJWMs gQYBcx pf-69_">Chair Material</span></p><p class="sc-TtZnY fPBQTR pf-70_" data-pf-type="Paragraph"><span data-pf-type="Text" class="sc-eGJWMs gQYBcx pf-72_">Just as the size of your new chair depends on its placement, the material of your new chair depends on its usage––heavy vs light––and the style you want to embody with the chair.<br><br>For example, if your chair will be used often, synthetic or natural leather will be more suitable because of its durability compared to more delicate materials like silk or velvet. <br><br>Similarly, leather and certain materials like metal, wood, and plastic can be easily wiped, making them better suited for daily use, especially if they are placed near the kitchen or dining areas.<br><br>Soft materials, like buttery leather, cushy upholstery, or velvet, feel more inviting and beckoning than plastic or metal. Don’t let that deter you though, you can always spruce up a metal or plastic chair by covering it with a sheepskin or a cozy faux throw blanket.&nbsp;</span></p><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2994/0144/t/185/assets/pf-b4695e7a--071821livingroomchairs04.jpg?v=1626633529" srcSet="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2994/0144/t/185/assets/pf-b4695e7a--071821livingroomchairs04.jpg?v=1626633529 1536w, https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2994/0144/t/185/assets/pf-b4695e7a--071821livingroomchairs04_500x.jpg?v=1626633529 320w" width="890" height="540" data-pf-type="Image" class="sc-carFqZ hBWCUB pf-154_"/><p class="sc-TtZnY fPBQTR pf-73_ avalon-demi" data-pf-type="Paragraph"><span data-pf-type="Text" class="sc-eGJWMs gQYBcx pf-75_">Home Style and Theme</span></p><p class="sc-TtZnY fPBQTR pf-76_" data-pf-type="Paragraph"><span data-pf-type="Text" class="sc-eGJWMs gQYBcx pf-78_">The style and theme of your living room and your home overall also influences your choice of chairs for your living room.

If your living room is styled in an informal way that oozes warmth and relaxation, an upright desk chair will be like the ‘thing that does not belong’.<br><br>The chair you choose should also complement the color scheme of your living room. Even if you find a chair that meets your purposes and fits in the perfect space of your living room, if it is not available in a color that complements it, that’s not your chair! You wouldn’t put a brown chair in a monochrome living room. <br><br>With that said, some colors and designs can get along with nearly every palette and style. A chair with wood finishing is almost universally acceptable, except perhaps in that monochrome living room. Neutral shades can blend into almost any home design scheme.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2994/0144/t/185/assets/pf-5e7ad800--071821livingroomchairs06.jpg?v=1626633705" srcSet="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2994/0144/t/185/assets/pf-5e7ad800--071821livingroomchairs06.jpg?v=1626633705 1536w, https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2994/0144/t/185/assets/pf-5e7ad800--071821livingroomchairs06_500x.jpg?v=1626633705 320w" width="890" height="540" data-pf-type="Image" class="sc-carFqZ hBWCUB pf-92_"/><p class="sc-TtZnY fPBQTR pf-89_" data-pf-type="Paragraph"><span data-pf-type="Text" class="sc-eGJWMs gQYBcx pf-91_">Figuring out how to choose chairs for your living room is both fun and frustrating.
