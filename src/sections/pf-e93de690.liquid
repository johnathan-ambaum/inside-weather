For centuries the dining table has represented feelings of joy, togetherness, and friendliness. It has also served as a multi-functional piece of furniture where families gather to play board games, children to do their homework and crafts, and for friends to socialize and engage in delightful conversation. Whether you are moving into a new space or simply looking to give your dining room a refresh, finding the right table for your room is of the utmost importance. So how can you determine which table is the right shape and size for you? We’re here to help! Review our dining room table guide below to make sure you’re selecting the best dining table option for you and your lifestyle.</span></p><p class="sc-lbVvki flSuVc pf-20_" data-pf-type="Paragraph"><span data-pf-type="Text" class="sc-jUfyBS eSyZIh pf-22_">First, let’s start with dining room table styles and heights. There are 3 main types of dining room tables: standard, bar, and counter. All standard dining tables should range from about 28”-30” in height. If a high top table makes more sense for you, then a bar height or counter height table is a great choice. A counter table size should range from 34”-36” in height, and a bar table should range from 40”-42” in height. Counter height and bar height tables are great for compact spaces, apartments, or more casual dining setups. </span></p><p class="sc-lbVvki flSuVc pf-23_" data-pf-type="Paragraph"><span data-pf-type="Text" class="sc-jUfyBS eSyZIh pf-25_">Next, let’s dive into dining room table shapes. The most common dining table shapes include the following:<br><br>• Rectangular<br>• Square<br>• Round<br>• Oval<br></span></p><p class="sc-lbVvki flSuVc pf-26_" data-pf-type="Paragraph"><span data-pf-type="Text" class="sc-jUfyBS eSyZIh pf-28_">If you are having trouble thinking of <a href="https://insideweather.com/blogs/the-weather-report/dining-room-ideas-for-apartments" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">apartment dining room table ideas</a> and deciding which table shape is right for you, you can start by thinking not only about personal preference, but also about what will be the most practical in your dining space. Every table shape comes in multiple lengths, so as a general rule of thumb, keep in mind that each guest should have anywhere from 24”-26” of personal horizontal space while seated at the table. You should also have a minimum of 36” of clearance between the edge of your table and the wall to allow for space for guests to move their chairs in and out. This should help you determine what overall length will work best within your dining area.</span></p><p class="sc-lbVvki flSuVc pf-29_" data-pf-type="Paragraph"><span data-pf-type="Text" class="sc-jUfyBS eSyZIh pf-31_">Nowadays, rectangular <a href="https://insideweather.com/blogs/the-weather-report/how-to-create-a-minimalist-dining-room" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">minimalist dining room</a> tables are the most common shape because they can be the most versatile. You can easily seat 4 people comfortably at a rectangular dining table, and often can fit 6 people by adding one person on each end. Many rectangular dining tables come with an extra leaf so you can extend the length of your table, therefore, adding space for even more guests. This is a great option if you are working with limited space because you can keep the leaf out and only add it in for crowded special occasions or nights where you’ll be hosting a larger group of friends for dinner. Generally speaking, a rectangular dining table should be anywhere from 36”-42” in width. If you go any narrower than 36”, you may find it difficult to place people on both sides of the table comfortably. Rectangular dining tables come in a plethora of lengths, so the length that’s right for you should be determined by the overall amount of space you have. Our <a href="https://insideweather.com/products/ud11lg1013-rectangle-custom-via-dining-table-in-white-marble" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">rectangular dining table</a> is an excellent choice if you are working within a smaller or more narrow space. </span></p><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2994/0144/t/185/assets/pf-fedcaa8f--050521blogdiningroomtables01.jpg?v=1620237941" srcSet="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2994/0144/t/185/assets/pf-fedcaa8f--050521blogdiningroomtables01.jpg?v=1620237941 1536w" data-pf-type="Image" class="sc-jJMGnK laKGqb pf-32_"/><p class="sc-lbVvki flSuVc pf-33_" data-pf-type="Paragraph"><span data-pf-type="Text" class="sc-jUfyBS eSyZIh pf-35_">A square dining table, obviously, most commonly fits only 4 place settings, so they are a good option if you have 4 less than 4 people within your home. Because square dining tables allow for all guests to be equidistant, they are a great option for conversationalists or if you are looking for something more intimate. At 42” in diameter, our <a href="https://insideweather.com/products/ud12lg1013-square-custom-via-dining-table-in-white-marble" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">square dining table</a> is the perfect size for those seeking that type of intimate dining table experience. Square dining tables will look best if you are working within a square room, otherwise, they may look disproportionate in the space. Some square tables also come with a leaf, which can be added to the middle to turn the table into a rectangle, therefore seating more guests as needed. </span></p><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2994/0144/t/185/assets/pf-c0773eb7--050521blogdiningroomtables02.jpg?v=1620238148" srcSet="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2994/0144/t/185/assets/pf-c0773eb7--050521blogdiningroomtables02.jpg?v=1620238148 1536w" data-pf-type="Image" class="sc-jJMGnK laKGqb pf-36_"/><p class="sc-lbVvki flSuVc pf-37_" data-pf-type="Paragraph"><span data-pf-type="Text" class="sc-jUfyBS eSyZIh pf-39_">Round dining tables have grown in popularity over the past several years because of their general aesthetic, however they may not always be the most functional. With the open floor plan concept becoming more and more common, homes have more space to place a large round dining table within their floor plan. Round dining tables are a good choice if you have a small square room to work with because the rounded edges will allow for the space to feel larger and more open. Our <a href="https://insideweather.com/products/ud10lg1013-round-custom-via-dining-table-in-white-marble" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">round dining table</a> comes in multiple finishes and hundreds of surface designs so we are certain there is a good choice for every unique space. Small round tables are intimate, but if you are going for a larger round table, keep in mind that it may be more difficult to engage in conversation with someone on the opposite side of the table. Similar to rectangular and square tables, many round tables also come with a leaf, so you may be able to collapse it for a more intimate vibe on a day-to-day basis, and expand it when you are hosting larger gatherings.</span></p><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2994/0144/t/185/assets/pf-3eb72f04--050521blogdiningroomtables03.jpg?v=1620238276" srcSet="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2994/0144/t/185/assets/pf-3eb72f04--050521blogdiningroomtables03.jpg?v=1620238276 1536w" data-pf-type="Image" class="sc-jJMGnK laKGqb pf-40_"/><p class="sc-lbVvki flSuVc pf-41_" data-pf-type="Paragraph"><span data-pf-type="Text" class="sc-jUfyBS eSyZIh pf-43_">Last on the list is the oval dining table. While this may not be the most popular table style, it is a really great option if you are working with a narrow space. Oval tables have a lot of similar attributes to rectangular tables as they are longer and can seat more people, however, they tend to have less surface area. If you are looking for a table that can seat more people, but don’t want the harsh lines of a rectangular table, then an oval shape may be the right fit for you.
