This grid is always 10 images so there should be input for 10 total images. how they are numbered/ordered is important, so when setting up the backend please make sure they are numbered based on the numbers in the image.

Each image, when clicked, opens a popup that shows the image and then lists the products in the image. The number of products per image varies so need to be able to add x number of products to that popup.

Images on desktop are the same as on mobile

CONFIGURABLE ELEMENTS:

lifestyle Image url
for each product listed on the popup of a specific image:

image url
destination url
text #1 (product name)
text #2 (price)
